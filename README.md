## Unity Space Shooter - F\# 

This is a version of the Unity Space Shooter beginner tutorial
with slight modifications for Unity 5 (primarily, using UI text
rather than GUI text).

Scripts are written in the F# programming language. This provides
some examples of how to expose fields in subclasses of MonoBehaviour
so that Unity can inject dependencies (and so that they show up
in the Unity inspector). The GameController script also includes
an example of how to create a coroutine in F#.
